h1. AdHoc distribution of iOS apps OTA

This small rack app using "jQTouch":http://.jqtouch.com/ makes it easy to distribute AdHoc builds of iOS apps over the air. This requires the client to be running OS 4.x

h2. Setup

Place the following files in /public/files

* AdHoc.mobileprovision
* AdHoc.plist
* YourApp.ipa

Update the URL for the following line below in /public/index.html

pre. itms-services://?action=download-manifest&amp;url=http://REPLACEME.com/files/AdHoc.plist


h2. Running

Everything is just static HTML so you can simply place is on any web server. I have included a rackup file so you can easily push to "Heroku":http://heroku.com/.


"Hockey":http://github.com/TheRealKerni/Hockey is more robust PHP version of this same idea. Here is Apple's "Documentation on Enterprise App Distribution":https://developer.apple.com/iphone/prerelease/library/featuredarticles/FA_Wireless_Enterprise_App_Distribution/Introduction/Introduction.html.
